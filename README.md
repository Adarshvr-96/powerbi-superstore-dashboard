## 📌 Overall Recommendations

-  *Monitor AOV Decline*: A 2.45% decline in AOV suggests smaller or more discounted orders — review pricing and product mix strategies.

-  *Reevaluate Furniture Category*: Tables and some Furniture items show negative profit — consider optimization or replacement.

-  *Double Down on High-Performing States*: States like California and New York offer strong sales — expand focus there.

-  *Boost Top Products*: Phones and Chairs perform well — prioritize them in promotions or upsell campaigns.
